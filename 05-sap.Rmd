## Core Statistical Work

---

## Chapter Objectives

The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) is the definitive document that governs how clinical trial data are analyzed and interpreted.  
This chapter provides a comprehensive and practical framework for developing a robust, regulator-ready SAP.

After completing this chapter, the reader should be able to:

- Define primary analysis methods with sufficient operational detail  
- Specify models, covariates, and stratification handling clearly  
- Plan secondary, exploratory, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses  
- Define coherent multiplicity and missing data strategies  
- Support interim analyses and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) activities, if applicable  
- Ensure all analyses are reproducible and implementable without post–database lock decisions  

---

## 5.1 Role of the SAP in Clinical Trials

### 5.1.1 Why the SAP Is a Critical Document

From a statistical perspective, the SAP serves as:

- The **binding interpretation** of the protocol  
- The **operational blueprint** for statistical programming  
- The **primary reference** for regulatory review and inspection  

Any analysis not prospectively specified in the SAP is vulnerable to being considered post hoc, regardless of scientific plausibility.

---

### 5.1.2 Relationship Between the Protocol and the SAP

- The **protocol** defines *what* will be studied  
- The **SAP** defines *how* the data will be analyzed  

The SAP must be fully consistent with the protocol while providing substantially more detail to remove analytical ambiguity.

---

## 5.2 Definition of the Primary Analysis Method

### 5.2.1 Purpose of the Primary Analysis

The primary analysis directly addresses the primary estimand and supports the main study conclusion.  
It must be defined in sufficient detail so that:

- Independent statisticians would implement the same analysis  
- Results are reproducible  
- No analytical discretion remains after database lock  

---

### 5.2.2 Model Type Specification

The SAP must explicitly specify the statistical model, including:

- Model family (e.g., linear model, generalized linear model, Cox model)  
- Link function, if applicable  
- Distributional assumptions  

Typical examples include:

- ANCOVA for continuous endpoints  
- Logistic regression for binary endpoints  
- Cox proportional hazards models for time-to-event endpoints  

Any key model assumptions should be stated and, where appropriate, assessed.

---

### 5.2.3 Covariate Specification

The SAP should clearly define:

- Which covariates are included in the model  
- Whether covariates are pre-specified or data-driven  
- How covariates are coded (continuous or categorical)  

Covariates typically include baseline measures of the endpoint or other strong prognostic factors identified during study design.

---

### 5.2.4 Handling of Stratification Factors

If stratified randomization was used, the SAP should specify:

- Whether stratification factors are included as covariates  
- Whether stratified tests or stratified models are applied  
- How sparse or empty strata are handled  

Consistency between randomization and analysis strategies is essential.

---

## 5.3 Secondary and Exploratory Analyses

### 5.3.1 Secondary Analyses

Secondary analyses address pre-specified secondary objectives and support interpretation of the primary results.  
They should be fully specified in the SAP but clearly distinguished from the primary analysis.

---

### 5.3.2 Exploratory Analyses

Exploratory analyses are hypothesis-generating and descriptive in nature.  
The SAP should outline their general analytical approach while clearly labeling them as exploratory.

---

## 5.4 Multiplicity Control Strategy

### 5.4.1 Importance of Multiplicity Control

Multiplicity affects the interpretation of statistical significance.  
The SAP must describe how Type I error is controlled across:

- Multiple endpoints  
- Multiple treatment comparisons  
- Multiple time points or analyses  

---

### 5.4.2 Common Multiplicity Approaches

Multiplicity strategies commonly specified in SAPs include:

- Hierarchical testing procedures  
- Gatekeeping strategies  
- Alpha-splitting or adjustment methods  

The chosen strategy must align with study objectives and be defined prior to unblinding.

---

## 5.5 Missing Data Handling Strategies

### 5.5.1 Importance of Pre-Specifying Missing Data Methods

Assumptions about missing data directly affect interpretation of treatment effects.  
The SAP must prospectively specify missing data handling methods for each key analysis.

---

### 5.5.2 Commonly Used Methods

The SAP should clearly state when and how the following methods are applied:

- **MMRM (Mixed Model for Repeated Measures)**  
- **Multiple Imputation (MI)**  
- **Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)**  
- **Non-Responder Imputation (NRI)**  

Each method’s assumptions and limitations should be acknowledged.

---

### 5.5.3 Alignment With Estimands

Missing data strategies should be consistent with the estimand framework (e.g., treatment policy, hypothetical, or composite strategies).

---

## 5.6 Definition of Repeat Assessments and Visit Window Rules

### 5.6.1 Purpose of Visit Window Rules

Repeated measurements and visit deviations must be handled consistently.  
The SAP should define:

- Visit windows  
- Rules for selecting analysis values  
- Handling of unscheduled or repeated assessments  

---

### 5.6.2 Statistical Rules for Repeat or Follow-Up Measurements

The SAP should specify:

- Which value is used when multiple measurements are available  
- Whether averaging or selection rules apply  
- How confirmatory or repeat tests are treated  

Clear rules prevent downstream programming discrepancies.

---

## 5.7 Sensitivity Analysis Plan

### 5.7.1 Purpose of Sensitivity Analyses

Sensitivity analyses evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis to key assumptions.  
They are essential for assessing the reliability of study conclusions.

---

### 5.7.2 Common Sensitivity Analyses

Examples include:

- Alternative missing data assumptions  
- Different analysis populations  
- Alternative model specifications  

Each sensitivity analysis should be linked to a specific assumption being tested.

---

## 5.8 Subgroup Analysis Definition

### 5.8.1 Purpose of Subgroup Analyses

Subgroup analyses explore the consistency of treatment effects across predefined subpopulations.

---

### 5.8.2 Pre-Specification Requirements

The SAP should define:

- Subgroup variables and category definitions  
- Statistical models used for subgroup analyses  
- Whether treatment-by-subgroup interaction tests are conducted  

Results should be interpreted cautiously and in context.

---

## 5.9 Interim Analysis and DMC Support (If Applicable)

### 5.9.1 Interim Analysis Specifications

If interim analyses are planned, the SAP should specify:

- Timing or triggering criteria  
- Statistical methods applied  
- Alpha spending or adjustment approaches  
- Decision boundaries  

---

### 5.9.2 DMC Support

The SAP may include or reference:

- Analysis outputs prepared for DMC review  
- Data handling procedures for unblinded analyses  
- Role separation and access controls  

Clear procedures are essential to protect study integrity.

---

## 5.10 SAP Quality and Implementation Checklist

Before finalizing the SAP, confirm that:

- [ ] All primary and secondary analyses are fully specified  
- [ ] Models, covariates, and stratification handling are explicit  
- [ ] Multiplicity and missing data strategies are defined  
- [ ] Sensitivity and subgroup analyses are pre-specified  
- [ ] Interim analyses and DMC procedures are clearly described, if applicable  
- [ ] All analyses can be implemented without post–database lock decisions  

---

## Chapter Summary

The SAP transforms study objectives and protocol concepts into executable statistical analyses.  
A high-quality SAP eliminates analytical ambiguity, ensures reproducibility, and provides a defensible basis for interpretation.

Careful, detailed, and prospective SAP development is one of the most critical responsibilities of the statistician in clinical research.
