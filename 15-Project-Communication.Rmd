## 15.1 Communication as a Core Biostatistics Competency

In clinical trials, strong statistical work is necessary but not sufficient. If statistical insights cannot be understood by non-statisticians, they cannot meaningfully influence decisions. Project communication is therefore not a “soft skill” add-on—it is a core professional responsibility for the Project Biostatistician.

Many project failures are not caused by incorrect analyses, but by:
- Statistical risks identified too late
- Risks communicated too weakly or too strongly
- Misalignment between statistics, medicine, and operations
- Late-stage surprises that could have been prevented earlier

Effective communication enables the statistician to act as a translator, risk signaler, and stabilizer—protecting scientific credibility while supporting timely, pragmatic decisions.

## 15.2 Participation in Project Team Meetings

### 15.2.1 Objectives in Regular Project Meetings

In routine project meetings, the biostatistician should avoid turning status updates into statistical lectures. The goal is to provide a decision-oriented summary that is understandable, actionable, and consistent with the study plan.

A practical three-question framework for each meeting update is:

1. **What does the data currently suggest?**  
2. **How confident are we—and why?**  
3. **What could still change the conclusion?**

This structure keeps the discussion focused on progress, uncertainty, and decision risk.

### 15.2.2 What to Bring to Every Meeting (Practical Checklist)

Bring clear, simple updates on:

- **Status**
  - What analyses are complete, in progress, or pending
  - Dependencies (data cleaning, database updates, programming timelines)

- **Risks**
  - Emerging issues such as imbalance, missingness, dropout patterns, protocol deviations
  - Items that could affect power, interpretability, or the primary endpoint

- **Decisions Needed**
  - What the team must decide (e.g., clarify rules, adjust timelines, request additional outputs)
  - What information is needed to make the decision

---

### 15.2.3 Common Communication Pitfalls

Common pitfalls that reduce statistical influence include:

- Using technical jargon without translation
- Providing excessive detail instead of a clear summary
- Raising concerns without ranking priority or explaining impact
- Staying silent until issues become critical (silence is often interpreted as “no risk”)

## 15.3 Participation in Medical Discussions

### 15.3.1 Bridging Statistical Evidence and Clinical Meaning

Medical discussions often focus on clinical relevance, benefit–risk balance, and real-world interpretability. The biostatistician’s role is to clarify what the data can and cannot support while aligning statistical interpretation with clinical decision needs.

Effective approaches include:
- Emphasizing the difference between “numerical trend” and “statistical evidence”
- Translating uncertainty into clinically meaningful terms
- Avoiding rigid language that sounds like rejection when the true message is uncertainty

Examples:
- Instead of “not statistically significant,” say:  
  “The data are compatible with both a small benefit and no benefit.”
- Instead of “wide confidence interval,” say:  
  “The estimate is still unstable due to limited information.”

---

### 15.3.2 Handling Disagreement Respectfully

When statistical conclusions conflict with clinical enthusiasm:
- Acknowledge the clinical perspective and the rationale behind it
- Restate the statistical constraints calmly and factually
- Emphasize uncertainty and evidentiary boundaries rather than negation

A useful mindset is:

> You are not saying “no.” You are saying “not yet proven.”

## 15.4 Participation in Regulatory Communication Meetings

### 15.4.1 What Regulators Expect From Statisticians

In regulatory meetings, statisticians are expected to:
- Support scientific consistency across protocol, SAP, TFLs, and CSR narratives
- Answer questions clearly and directly
- Avoid speculation beyond submitted materials
- Maintain precise language and consistent terminology

Regulators focus on statistical reasoning and defensibility—not programming details.

---

### 15.4.2 Practical Communication Principles in Regulatory Settings

- Answer the question asked—no more, no less
- Be precise rather than verbose
- Use consistent terms aligned with the SAP and CSR
- Avoid introducing new analyses unless explicitly requested
- Separate confirmatory and exploratory evidence clearly

Over-explaining can unintentionally create new questions.

## 15.5 Explaining Statistical Concepts in Non-Statistical Language

### 15.5.1 The Translation Responsibility

A Project Biostatistician must translate statistical concepts into decision language. If stakeholders cannot restate the message correctly, communication has failed—regardless of statistical correctness.

Practical translations:

| Statistical Term | Decision-Oriented Translation |
|---|---|
| p-value > 0.05 | The data do not rule out chance as an explanation. |
| Confidence interval | The plausible range of the true effect based on the data we have. |
| Sensitivity analysis | We tested whether conclusions change under reasonable assumptions. |
| Missing not at random | Dropouts may differ in a way that could bias the result. |
| Model assumption | This conclusion depends on assumptions about how outcomes behave over time. |
| Multiplicity | More comparisons increase the chance of false positives unless controlled. |

---

### 15.5.2 Practical Tips for Clear Statistical Explanations

- Start with the decision implication, then provide the statistical reason
- Use analogies carefully (only when they clarify, not oversimplify)
- Use ranges and scenarios rather than single-point certainty
- Repeat key messages consistently across meetings and documents

## 15.6 Communicating Risk to Sponsors Without Creating Panic

### 15.6.1 Balanced Risk Communication

Sponsors need early warning signals—not alarm bells. Effective risk communication is calm, structured, and solution-oriented.

A recommended structure is:

1. **What we are seeing**
2. **Why it may matter**
3. **What could happen if nothing changes**
4. **What we can do now**

This format provides clarity without creating unnecessary fear.

---

### 15.6.2 Avoiding Common Sponsor Communication Mistakes

Common mistakes include:
- Overstating uncertainty and creating panic
- Downplaying real risks to avoid difficult conversations
- Using overly technical language that reduces comprehension
- Communicating risks too late, causing surprise and mistrust

Trust is built when sponsors feel informed, not surprised.

## 15.7 Building Trust: The Statistician as a Project Advisor

The most effective project statisticians:
- Speak early rather than late
- Speak clearly rather than technically
- Speak honestly rather than defensively

They become trusted advisors who:
- Interpret risk
- Support decisions
- Protect scientific credibility
- Keep the team aligned and calm under uncertainty

## 15.8 Key Takeaways

1. Communication is a core statistical competency, not a soft skill.
2. The goal is shared understanding, not technical completeness.
3. Early, calm risk communication prevents crisis.
4. Non-statistical language increases statistical impact.
5. A trusted statistician shapes decisions without creating unnecessary alarm.
