*From Numbers to Evidence*

Statistical analysis execution is the point at which a clinical trial transitions from **data readiness** to **scientific evidence**.  
At this stage, the biostatistician is no longer preparing for analysis—the statistician is producing results that will be interpreted, challenged, and judged by regulators, clinicians, and decision-makers.

The responsibility here extends beyond computational correctness to **analytical credibility, transparency, and interpretability**.

---

## 11.1 The Nature of Statistical Execution

Statistical execution is often mistaken for:
- Running predefined programs
- Producing tables, figures, and listings
- Checking whether p-values cross thresholds

In reality, execution requires continuous professional judgment to answer:

> **Do these results faithfully represent what the data can—and cannot—support?**

---

## 11.2 Generation of Primary Analysis Results

### 11.2.1 Primary Analysis as the Anchor

The primary analysis is the **center of gravity** for:
- Regulatory conclusions
- Labeling decisions
- Scientific credibility

All other analyses exist to support, contextualize, or stress-test this result.

---

### 11.2.2 Execution Discipline for the Primary Analysis

Statisticians must ensure that the primary analysis:
- Strictly follows the SAP finalized prior to database lock
- Uses the correct analysis population
- Implements the specified estimand, model, covariates, and handling of intercurrent events

Key execution checks include:
- Verification of population flags
- Confirmation of endpoint derivations
- Reproducibility across independent runs and environments

A critical rule:
> **If the primary result is unexpected, verify implementation before interpreting biology.**

---

## 11.3 Secondary and Sensitivity Analyses

### 11.3.1 Role of Secondary Analyses

Secondary analyses:
- Address additional endpoints
- Provide supportive context
- Characterize treatment effects more broadly

They are **not substitutes** for a weak or failed primary analysis.  
Interpretation must reflect their inferential status and any multiplicity control.

---

### 11.3.2 Sensitivity Analyses as Stress Tests

Sensitivity analyses answer one question:

> **Do conclusions remain stable when assumptions change?**

Common sensitivity dimensions include:
- Missing data strategies (e.g., MMRM vs MI)
- Alternative estimand strategies
- Different analysis populations
- Alternative visit windowing rules

A strong primary result should be robust to reasonable sensitivities; a weak result cannot be rescued by them.

---

## 11.4 Subgroup Analyses

### 11.4.1 Purpose and Limitations

Subgroup analyses aim to:
- Assess consistency of treatment effects
- Explore potential effect modifiers
- Inform future hypotheses and research

Unless explicitly powered and controlled, subgroup analyses are **exploratory**.

---

### 11.4.2 Statistical Responsibilities in Subgroup Analysis

Statisticians must:
- Ensure subgroup definitions align with the SAP
- Limit proliferation of post-hoc subgroups
- Present estimates with appropriate uncertainty and caution

A common pitfall:
> **When subgroups disagree, the correct conclusion is uncertainty—not selective emphasis.**

Forest plots should communicate patterns, not promises.

---

## 11.5 Supporting Interpretation of Unexpected Results

### 11.5.1 Technical Validation First

When results conflict with expectations, statisticians should first assess:
- Data integrity and completeness
- Model assumptions and convergence
- Sensitivity to influential observations

Only after technical validation should scientific interpretation begin.

---

### 11.5.2 Explaining Without Over-Explaining

Statisticians support interpretation by:
- Quantifying uncertainty
- Clarifying what the data do and do not show
- Preventing overinterpretation of chance findings

A key discipline:
> **Explanation should illuminate uncertainty, not conceal it.**

---

## 11.6 Joint Interpretation with Medical Experts

### 11.6.1 Complementary Roles

Medical experts contribute:
- Clinical context and biological plausibility
- Individual case insight
- Risk–benefit interpretation

Statisticians contribute:
- Quantitative evidence and uncertainty characterization
- Methodological boundaries
- Guardrails against inferential overreach

Neither role is sufficient alone.

---

### 11.6.2 Effective Statistical Communication

Statisticians should:
- Translate numerical outputs into clear, accurate statements
- Distinguish pre-specified from exploratory findings
- Challenge conclusions that exceed statistical support

An experienced statistician knows when to say:
> **“That conclusion goes beyond what the data can support.”**

---

## 11.7 Common Risks During Analysis Execution

Experienced statisticians remain alert to:
- Quiet deviations from the SAP
- Selective emphasis on favorable findings
- Overreliance on nominal p-values
- Pressure to simplify or downplay uncertainty

Once results are generated, **analytical shortcuts become credibility risks**.

---

## 11.8 Chapter Summary: Execution as Professional Judgment

Statistical analysis execution is where:
- Technical rigor meets scientific judgment
- Numbers become evidence
- Professional integrity becomes visible

The statistician’s value in this phase lies in:
- Faithful implementation of planned analyses
- Honest representation of uncertainty
- Constructive partnership with medical interpretation

**Key takeaway:**

> **Statistical execution is not about producing results—it is about producing results that deserve to be believed.**
