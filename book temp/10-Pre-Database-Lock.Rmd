# Chapter 10: Pre-Database Lock Activities  
*The Statistician’s Final Accountability Before Results Are Frozen*

The period immediately preceding database lock represents the **final opportunity for statistical judgment to materially influence the integrity, interpretability, and regulatory defensibility of trial results**.

At this stage, no new analyses are being invented.  
Instead, the statistician’s responsibility is to **confirm alignment**—between plans and reality, definitions and data, and analytical intent and execution.

Once the database is locked, unresolved issues become explanation problems rather than fixable problems.

---

## 10.1 Why the Pre-Lock Phase Is Statistically Critical

The pre-lock phase is often misinterpreted as an administrative checkpoint.  
From a statistical perspective, it is a **decision boundary**.

Before database lock:
- SAP assumptions are confronted with real data
- Analysis datasets transition from conceptual definitions to fixed objects
- TFL shells become binding deliverables

After database lock:
- Analysis definitions are frozen
- Population flags are no longer negotiable
- Deviations must be justified rather than corrected

For the biostatistician, this is the **last point at which technical authority can prevent downstream analytical risk**.

---

## 10.2 Final Review of TFL Shells

### 10.2.1 Why TFL Shells Must Be Finalized Before Lock

TFL shells are not formatting artifacts.  
They formally define:
- What endpoints will be summarized
- Which populations will be analyzed
- How data will be stratified or grouped
- What comparisons will be reported

If a shell cannot be populated cleanly using existing analysis datasets, the issue lies upstream—in definitions, not presentation.

---

### 10.2.2 Statistical Verification of TFL Shells

During final TFL shell review, statisticians must confirm that:
- Titles, footnotes, and population labels align with the SAP
- Endpoint definitions match available ADaM variables
- Planned stratifications and subgroup analyses are derivable
- No post-hoc endpoints or populations are implicitly introduced

A practical rule:
> **If a shell requires interpretive explanation to understand how it will be filled, it is not ready for database lock.**

---

## 10.3 Confirming Consistency Between SAP and Actual Data

### 10.3.1 The Required Reality Check

The SAP defines an idealized analytical framework.  
The collected data reflect operational reality.

Before database lock, statisticians must explicitly assess:
- Existence of all SAP-defined variables
- Adequacy of data granularity for planned analyses
- Continued defensibility of SAP assumptions

This assessment focuses on **material consistency**, not perfection.

---

### 10.3.2 Common Sources of Misalignment

Frequent discrepancies include:
- Planned visits that rarely occurred
- Endpoints with higher-than-anticipated missingness
- Covariates inconsistently collected across subjects
- Time windows misaligned with actual visit timing

When misalignment is identified, statisticians must determine whether:
- The SAP can be applied as written
- A justified SAP amendment is required before lock
- The issue can be addressed through pre-specified sensitivity analyses

Silence at this stage constitutes implicit endorsement.

---

## 10.4 Confirmation of Analysis Dataset Definitions

### 10.4.1 Transition to Lock-Ready Analysis Datasets

By the pre-lock phase, analysis datasets (typically ADaM) must be:
- Fully specified
- Deterministically derivable
- Consistent with the SAP

This includes finalization of:
- Dataset structures
- Variable derivations
- Population flags
- Parameter-level metadata

---

### 10.4.2 Statistical Confirmation Responsibilities

Statisticians should explicitly verify that:
- Each analysis dataset aligns with SAP specifications
- Key variables are uniquely and reproducibly derived
- Population flags are deterministic and traceable to source data
- No analysis-critical derivation depends on post-lock decisions

A guiding principle:
> **If a derivation still depends on judgment calls, it is not ready for database lock.**

---

## 10.5 Statistical Sign-Off Prior to Database Lock

### 10.5.1 Meaning of Statistical Sign-Off

Statistical sign-off is not a procedural formality.  
It represents a professional assertion:

> **Based on statistical review, the data and definitions are sufficient to support the planned analyses as specified.**

It does not imply:
- Data perfection
- Guaranteed favorable results
- Absence of sensitivity analyses

It confirms that analyses will be:
- Reproducible
- Interpretable
- Defensible to regulators and auditors

---

### 10.5.2 Scope of Statistical Accountability

By providing sign-off, the statistician confirms that:
- TFL shells are executable and SAP-consistent
- SAP assumptions remain materially valid
- Analysis dataset definitions are finalized
- Outstanding issues are documented and accepted

Concerns not documented before lock will be assumed **not to exist**.

---

## 10.6 Common Pitfalls in the Pre-Lock Phase

Experienced statisticians remain alert to:
- Deferring issues with “we will explain it in the CSR”
- Last-minute shell changes without SAP updates
- Ambiguous population definitions left unresolved
- Pressure to sign off without sufficient review time

A critical lesson:
> **Schedule pressure does not diminish statistical responsibility.**

---

## 10.7 Chapter Summary: Database Lock as a Line of No Return

Database lock marks a definitive boundary.  
Before it, statisticians can prevent analytical failure.  
After it, they can only manage interpretive risk.

The statistician’s value at this stage lies in:
- Enforcing clarity before commitment
- Challenging misalignment before irreversibility
- Protecting analytical credibility under time pressure

**Key takeaway:**

> **Database lock freezes not only the data, but every statistical decision left unchallenged.**
